name: motion-pharo-ast-patterns
description: Create MoTion patterns in Pharo to match FAST models. Use when a user asks to write or adapt MoTion patterns for TypeScript AST, Java AST or XML AST. Route TypeScript work to MoTion.md + FASTTypeScript-MoTion.md, and XML work to MoTion.md + FASTXML-MoTion.md, and Java work to MoTion.md + FASTJava-MoTion.md.

# MoTion Pharo AST Patterns

## Workflow

1. Identify the target AST domain from the user request.
2. Load base MoTion guidance from `references/MoTion.md`.
3. Load exactly one domain guide:
- TypeScript AST: `references/FASTTypeScript-MoTion.md`
- XML AST: `references/FASTXML-MoTion.md`
- Java AST: `references/FASTJava-MoTion.md`
4. If the user does not know where to find or install the repositories needed for MoTion or the FAST libraries, direct them to the Repositories.md file, which explains how to obtain and install the correct repositories.
5. Build or revise the pattern in Pharo syntax.
6. Return the pattern and a short explanation of key selectors/operators used.

## Domain Routing

Use this routing consistently:

- If the request mentions TypeScript, JavaScript/TS source code, or FAST TypeScript nodes, use:
`references/MoTion.md` and `references/FASTTypeScript-MoTion.md`.

- If the request mentions XML, tags/attributes, or FAST XML nodes, use:
`references/MoTion.md` and `references/FASTXML-MoTion.md`.

- If the request mentions Java, tags/attributes, or FAST Java nodes, use:
`references/MoTion.md` and `references/FASTJava-MoTion.md`.

If the request is ambiguous, ask whether the target is TypeScript AST, Java AST or XML AST before writing the final pattern.

## Output Rules

1. Return valid Pharo/MoTion pattern code.
2. Keep the pattern minimal and composable.
3. Include assumptions when node types are inferred.
4. When asked to improve an existing pattern, preserve user intent and explain the delta briefly.

## References

Always treat these files as source of truth:
- `references/MoTion.md`
- `references/FASTTypeScript-MoTion.md`
- `references/FASTXML-MoTion.md`
- `references/FASTJava-MoTion.md`
- `references/Repositories.md` (for locating required repositories)
